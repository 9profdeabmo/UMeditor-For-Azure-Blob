3. Connect the other end of the cable to your car's OBD-II port, which is usually located under the dashboard on the driver's side.
4. Turn on the ignition of your car, but do not start the engine.
5. Run VAG-COM on your PC and select the appropriate COM port for the cable. You can test the connection by clicking on [Options] and then [Test]. You should see a message that says "Port Status: OK, Interface: Found!"
6. Select the [Auto-Scan] function to scan all the control modules in your car and display their fault codes. You can save or print the scan results for future reference.
7. Select the [Select Control Module] function to access a specific module and view its live data, perform basic settings, code new values, or clear fault codes. You can also use the [Applications] function to access some special features, such as measuring blocks, output tests, or service reminder reset.
