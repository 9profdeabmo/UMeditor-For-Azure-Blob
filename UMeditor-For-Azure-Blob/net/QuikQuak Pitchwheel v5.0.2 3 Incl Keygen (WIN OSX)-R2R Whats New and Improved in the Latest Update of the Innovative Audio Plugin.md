QuikQuak Pitchwheel is a plug-in that allows you to freely alter the pitch and timbre of a sound in real-time. It has a large, easy to use dial and simple parameters making it a fast and creative effect unit. It can give fine tuning control from fractions of a semitone to huge multi-octave pitch swings. You can also play 8 note chords through MIDI, allowing harmonies to be constructed easily from the audio input.
 
The plug-in works by moving towards the desired pitch at sample accuracy, enabling smooth transitions without stepping artifacts. You can create a DJ turntable feel with some play, but the difference here is that the tempo remains the same, so your track can go on without sequence timing changes. You can also use it static, and with the timbre wheel you can alter the character of a voice completely. The stereo image is kept intact on all pitches, without movement across the channels.

If you are looking for a versatile and easy to use pitch shifting plug-in, QuikQuak Pitchwheel might be a good option for you. You can download it from the official website[^1^] or from other file hosting services[^2^].

To use QuikQuak Pitchwheel, you need to install it as a plug-in for your audio host software. The plug-in supports Audio Unit and VST compatible hosts, and works as a mono and stereo effects plug-in. Please consult your host's manual for FX usage and routing.
 
Once you have loaded the plug-in on your audio track, you can start playing with the pitch and timbre wheels. The pitch wheel allows you to change the pitch of a sound from one semitone to an octave up or down, or even more if you use the gravity and inertia controls. The timbre wheel allows you to change the spectral envelope of a sound, which can alter the character of a voice or instrument. You can also lock the wheels to prevent accidental changes.
