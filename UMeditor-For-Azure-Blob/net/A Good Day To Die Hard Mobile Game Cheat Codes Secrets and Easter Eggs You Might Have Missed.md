However, the game can be quite challenging and frustrating at times, especially if you run out of ammo or health. That's why we have compiled a list of cheat codes that can help you unlock all levels and weapons in the game, so you can enjoy the action without any hassle.
 
To enter the cheat codes, you need to go to the main menu of the game and tap on the "Extras" option. Then, select the "Cheats" option and enter one of the following codes:
 
- **ALLLEVELS**: This code unlocks all levels in the game, so you can skip any stage you want.
- **ALLWEAPONS**: This code unlocks all weapons in the game, including pistols, shotguns, rifles, grenades, and rocket launchers.
- **GODMODE**: This code makes you invincible, so you can't die or take any damage from enemies or explosions.
- **INFINITEAMMO**: This code gives you unlimited ammo for all weapons, so you don't have to worry about reloading or running out of bullets.
- **MAXHEALTH**: This code restores your health to full, so you can heal yourself anytime you need.

These cheat codes can make the game more fun and easy for you, but they also disable the achievements and leaderboards in the game. So, use them at your own risk and discretion.

If you are wondering whether the game is worth playing, you might want to check out some of the reviews from critics and players. The game has received mixed reactions, with some praising its graphics, sound effects, and voice acting, while others criticizing its gameplay, controls, and story.
 
According to IGN, the game is "a bloated action sequel that makes the same mistakes as its predecessor, with John McClane more indestructible superhero than cop, deftly defying death at every turn" [^2^]. Polygon also notes that the game is "a fairly standard third-person shooter that doesn't do much to stand out from the crowd" [^3^]. However, some players have enjoyed the game for its fast-paced action and faithful adaptation of the movie.
 
The game is available for Android and iOS devices, and you can download it from Google Play Store or App Store for free.
